Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python.
==>Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
example:
Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname


  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

x = Person("Mahi", "Patel")
x.printname()

To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
example:
class Student(Person):
  pass

  The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
