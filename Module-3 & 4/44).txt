How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?
To set the starting value in generating random numbers, you can use the `random.seed()` function from the `random` module in Python. 
The `random.seed()` function initializes the random number generator with a given seed value.

Here's how you can set the starting value for generating random numbers:

1. Import the `random` module at the beginning of your script:
   ```python
   import random
   ```

2. Set the seed value using the `random.seed()` function. The seed value can be any hashable object, such as an integer or a string.
   ```python
   random.seed(123)  # Set the seed value to 123
   ```

3. After setting the seed, you can generate random numbers using the various functions from the `random` module, a
   nd they will produce the same sequence of random numbers every time you run the script.
   ```python
   random_number = random.random()
   ```

By setting the same seed value, you can ensure that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers, 
which can be useful for replicating results or debugging purposes.

Note: If you don't explicitly set a seed value, the random number generator uses the current system time as the default seed value.
